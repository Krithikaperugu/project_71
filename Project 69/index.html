                                    <p class="text-muted text-left">The farewell party for the outgoing batches, class X and XII was organised by the students of classes IX and XI. The theme being “Neon Lights”, there was an explosion of fluorescent colours and lights all around the school campus. The students were welcomed and the School Vice Captain Nandini Malhotra delivered a speech of gratitude. The students were then presented with mementos and gifts as they walked the ramp. The students of classes IX and XI put up fabulous dance performances to entertain the audience. The School Captain Thasya Harsha Shetty and Aishwarya Naidu went down the memory lane, were nostalgic but decided not to get emotional. We then had the final round for the nominees vying for the various titles, ‘Miss Crowning Glory’, ‘Miss Couture’, ‘Miss Elegance’, ‘Miss Rising Star’ and ‘Miss Nasr’. They had to walk the ramp and answer to the questions put forth. The judges had a difficult task of choosing Miss Nasr. Miss Asmita Amritraj was crowned ‘Miss Rising Star’ and Miss Nadia Jowkar won the ‘Miss Nasr’ title. Mrs Rebecca and Mrs Deepika inspired the students and gave them their best wishes through a song, ‘Hero’. As the sun went down, the jam session began which was absolutely thrilling as the girls along with the teachers danced to their heart’s content. Delicious food was served under beautiful canopies.
A short video on the outgoing batches made the girls nostalgic and they were seen hugging each other with tears in their eyes. The farewell party was a day filled with joy and a day that created memories for a lifetime.

                                    <p>The students were welcomed to the first club meeting by Mrs Puneeta Singh. She highlighted the importance of nature in our lives and what can we do to protect our environment. Miss Atifa Noorain was nominated as the club President and Miss Riya Agarwal as the Vice President. 
 
The theme for the year is Safe planet—Say No to plastic. The girls were told about the hazards of using plastic and how it harms even the animals. Each member was asked to make 5 cards and sell them for Rs.20/- each. The money collected would go towards buying 4 dustbins for our school one each for wet, dry, degradable and non degradable waste.
 
Mrs. Neetu Kela taught the girls how to make paper bags from old newspapers 
 
The meeting ended with the school song.</p>

for her lover Pyramus had the Devil's cheek.
The stealth the two lovers conspired at dawn,
before their parents had realised the betrayal,
the smitten couple had already gone.

The cloak left behind as she ran for her life,
quenched not the thirst of the lion's strife.
But alas! Pyramus had known not,
and not a single doubt had he fought,
as he gave up on the pointless resistance to death,
as soon as his sight with the blood-stained cloak met.
He weeped at the thought of his misfortune,
his tears could even melt the heart of God Neptune.

He wrung his hands and wiped his face,
his emotions wept off, leaving a solitary trace,
his lover had died, oh what a shame,
he leapt to his death, jumped onto the sword,
crying out loud, his inamorata's name.
His blood splashed onto the mulberry tree,
as his soul left his body, into the other world, free.

The oblivious lover returns to the scene, 
for she had outsmarted the wild beast, her heart smiled with glee.
She had nothing to lose, but love to gain,
but what she came across made her face contort with pain.
the agony left her body with a loud scream,
she ran towards her dead inamorato, wishing this was a dream.
The lifeless body of her dear plunged her heart,
"In death does his beauty shine so bright, oh my love, you were a work of art,
wake up, my darling, rise,
tell me how much you love stealth, our love in disguise",
She shrieks in horror and the tragedy she denies,
that could not be their end, not a sad demise.

She wrings her hands and wipes her face,
her petite body leaving not a single trace,
she jumps onto the sword, as a tear drips down,
oh, she'd imagined the marriage vows and the wedding gown.
All her hopes had shattered to naught,
she gave up her life, and a lesson she taught,
to the faithful couples and the unrequited love,
Aphrodite shed a sob, as she rode her chariot of dove,
over the remains of the lovers and the love they had,
the Gods above feared an intimacy so mad,
to honour the duo's lament and derange,
the mulberry tree was marked with red, the colour of love had to change.
